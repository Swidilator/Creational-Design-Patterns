## About

This code is my 'copy' for the code used in the Udemy course. If varies from the course provided code in a few ways:

Written in CLion using CMake, instead of Visual Studio and MS Build.
Written as one CMake project with separate executables for each design pattern.
Written on Linux with Clang, instead of Windows with MSVC.
